I have started to build a new GUI that serves as billing Sytem for a concession stand. My first steps are to create to format 
the first window by creating a fram. This allows me to work on the first window without interfering with the title of the Program.

I created all of the Labels and foramted the entry boxes and item type into rows and columns. After creating the forst one simply 
copying and pasting the the first item foramt for the rest of the item helped me save time. I then swithed the variable to better match
items and to not have overlapping variable and change the column and rows to prevnt them from stacking on the first row and column.

Then I created a function in pyhton to open a secondary window with a button. I used the same foramt as the main page making the problem 
easier to solve and then created a "Receipt Button", this would be used to make the function work and open the new window.

In the final project I have complete added the type of item that will be in the GUI nad it allows you to select the quatity and price 
of each item. Some of the problems that I have face are foramtting the buttons and what to make my second window. I will figure out how to 
foramt in the best way possible to meet the requierments.

Lasty I created the format for the receipt layout and made sure all of the math was done correct. I then added up all of the item totals 
to give me the Final Total of the program. I also created a secondary button that woul operate as a exit function which would stop and exit 
program.
